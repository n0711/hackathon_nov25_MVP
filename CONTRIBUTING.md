# Contributing to LearnTwin

Thanks for your interest in contributing to LearnTwin!

This project aims to provide an open learning-analytics core that educators,
researchers, and developers can use, extend, and integrate into their own systems.

## Ways you can help

- Improve documentation and examples
- Add or refine AI / learning-analytics logic
- Add integrations (data loaders, exports, connectors)
- Improve tests and code quality
- Open issues with ideas, bugs, or feedback

## Development setup (Windows + PowerShell)

Typical local setup:

- Clone the repository
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Run tests

## Code style

- Python 3.10+
- Prefer clear, well-documented code over clever one-liners
- Use type hints where it makes the intent clearer

## Tests

- Add or update tests when you change behaviour
- Make sure all tests pass before opening a pull request

## Issues and pull requests

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, questions, and feature ideas
- In pull requests, explain what you changed and why
